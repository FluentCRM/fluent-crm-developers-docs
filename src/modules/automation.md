# Automation
The automation module is a powerful tool for creating and managing complex workflows. It allows you to create workflows 
that can be triggered by different events and run some actions till the workflow reaches to a benchmark. FLuentCRM provides a set of predefined
events that you can use to trigger 
your workflows. You can also create your own custom action and trigger to reach a benchmark. Now, you can see there are three 
different types of automation in FluentCRM. They are:
- trigger
- action
- benchmark

We will go through each of them one by one.
## Trigger vs Action vs Benchmark
### Trigger
An event or action that initiates a specific automated response, that is what we call a trigger.
For example, when a user subscribes to a newsletter, this action is considered a trigger.
A trigger is the foundation of any automation process, it starts the series of actions that follows. The trigger is the first step of automation.

### Action
An action is a precise task that is carried out when a specific trigger occurs.
In the context of an application, an action is a programmed response to an event or user interaction.
For instance, when a user subscribes to a newsletter, an action could be sending a welcoming email. 
These actions can be custom-made and tailored to perform any desired task. Creating an action such as adding a tag to a user when they subscribe to your newsletter, 
is just one example of the flexibility actions provide in automating processes. It's the programmed response to a trigger that makes automation happen.
Simply, trigger is something that is done by user, action is what the program do in response.

### Benchmark
A benchmark is goal or target that you want to reach. For example, when a user clicks on a link in your email then it's a benchmark.
Let's have examples of each one. We will start with the trigger first.
