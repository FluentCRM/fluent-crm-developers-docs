# Form Field Code Structure

Fluent CRM offers an easy way to create forms without any knowledge of HTML or JavaScript by using its structural format for generating form fields. The form fields are determined by this structure.

There are 26 different types of form fields available in Fluent CRM. In addition to the specific form fields, there are also some common and optional fields that can be included in every form block. These common and optional fields include:

<table>
    <thead>
        <tr>
            <th>Key</th>
            <th>Description </th>
        </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
        <tr>
            <td>label</td>
            <td>The `label` value is a string that will be displayed as the label for the form field.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>inline_help</td>
            <td>The `inline_help` value is a string that will be displayed as inline help text for the form field.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>placeholder</td>
            <td>The `placeholder` value is a string that will be displayed as the placeholder text in the form field when no option has been selected.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>help</td>
            <td>The `help` value is a string that will be displayed as a help text for the form field.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>wrapper_class</td>
            <td>(Optional) The `wrapper_class` value specifies a class that will be applied to the wrapper element for the form field.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>

            <td>(Optional) If this property is true, then the field will be read-only</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>

## Option selectors

```php
'subscription_status' => [
    'type'        => 'option_selectors',
    'option_key'  => 'editable_statuses',
    'is_multiple' => false,
    'label'       => 'Subscription Status',
    'placeholder' => 'Select Status'
]
```

This code is defining an array with keys and values for a form field in Fluent CRM. The form field has the key 'subscription_status', and the values for this field include:

- `type`: `option_selectors`
- `option_key`: `editable_statuses`
- `is_multiple`: false

The `type` value indicates that this form field is an `option_selectors` field, which is a type of form field that allows the user to select one or more options from a list. The `option_key` value specifies the key for the list of options that will be displayed in the form field, which in this case is `editable_statuses`. The `is_multiple` value is a boolean indicating whether the user can select multiple options from the list or just one.

<table>
    <thead>
        <tr>
            <th>Key</th>
            <th>Description</th>
        </tr>

        </tr>
        <tr>

This code is defining an array with keys and values for a form field in Fluent CRM. The form field has the key `to_day`, and the value for this field is:

- `type`: `checkboxes`
- `wrapper_class`: `fc_2col_inline pad-r-20`
- `options`: an array of checkbox options

The `type` value indicates that this form field is a `checkboxes` field, which is a type of form field that allows the user to select one or more options from a list of checkboxes. The `wrapper_class` value is a string that specifies a class name for the container element that wraps this form field. 

The `options` value is an array of checkbox options, where each option is an array containing an `id` and `title` value. The `id` value is a string that specifies the unique identifier for the checkbox option, and the `title` value is a string that will be displayed as the label for the checkbox option.

#### options possible sets:

<table>
    <thead>
        <tr>
            <th>key</th>
            <th>Description</th>
        </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
         <tr>
            <td>id</td>
            <td>The value of `id` is a unique identifier for a option</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>title</td>
            <td>The value of `title` is the title for a option</td>
        </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>

## Time selector

```php
'to_day_time'        => [
    'label'          => 'Time of the day',
    'type'           => 'time_selector',
    'placeholder'    => 'Select Time',
    'wrapper_class'  => 'fc_2col_inline',
    'picker_options' => [
        'start' => '00:00',
        'step'  => '00:10',
        'end'   => '23:59'
    ]
]
```

The `to_day_time` field is a time selector that allows the user to select a specific time of the day. The time picker has options for the start time, time increment step, and end time. The start time is set to 00:00 (midnight), the step is set to 10 minutes, and the end time is set to 23:59 (one minute before midnight). The `to_day_time` field is displayed in a two column layout and has a placeholder text of "Select Time". It is likely used in conjunction with the `to_day` field to specify a specific day and time for the wait period.
