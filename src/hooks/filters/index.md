<Badge type="tip" vertical="top" text="FluentCRM Core" /> <Badge type="warning" vertical="top" text="Intermediate" />

FluentCRM has many interesting filter hooks that let developers change default settings and even extend FluentCRM with new functionality.

## What are Filter Hooks

A hook is a feature that allows developers to manipulate functionality without modifying core files. A hook can help developers inject some functions or edit default settings.
  
Filter hooks are used to return modified values for certain parameters, based on different factors.
